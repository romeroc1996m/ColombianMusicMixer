                        Barranquilla's Carnival is one of the most popular traditions in Colombia, matching cultural and folkloric celebrations. This carnival dates back to the colonial period, when the Spanish conquest introduced Spanish and Portuguese traditions in America (Colombia Travel). During this carnival, the most important song is named "La canci√≥n del carnival," or the carnival's song, played by Checo Acosta, which you're going to be able to listen to in this game:
